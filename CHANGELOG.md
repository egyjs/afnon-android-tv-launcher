# Changelog

All notable changes to Afnon. Versions match `versionName` in `app/build.gradle` and the `vX.Y` git tags.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Oman's Holy Quran Radio (إذاعة القرآن الكريم، سلطنة عُمان, ayn.om/live/164) in Settings → Radio: its public HLS
  stream on the Mangomolo CDN, which plays without a token. It adds the host `partwota.cdn.mgmlcdn.com` to the
  README's Privacy list.

## [0.5] - 2026-10-22

### Added
- Settings → Reminders → Close the call screen: when the adhan ends, or 1, 5 or 10 minutes after it appears (10,
  as before, by default). Then it's back to what was playing. With no adhan playing (turned off, or stopped with
  the button), "when the adhan ends" closes it after a minute. The call screen's hint says which.
- Spoken reminder: «اقترب موعد صلاة …» with the reminder card or banner (Settings → Reminders, on by default).
- Announce the time: «حان الآن موعد صلاة …» when a prayer's time begins with its adhan off, either for all prayers
  or by that prayer's bell (on by default). Friday says الجمعة. Both lower whatever is playing for a moment
  instead of pausing it, and each is said once per prayer, also across a restart of the remote buttons service.
  The 12 clips are not in the repo: `tools/fetch-announce.sh` (run by `install.sh` the first time) records
  them with a Microsoft neural Arabic voice through edge-tts into `app/src/main/assets/announce/`; without them
  both stay silent. Release APKs include them. `--es test announce` tries it; `--es test banner` and
  `--es test reminder` now say the reminder too.

### Changed
- The reminder can come 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes before each prayer (or not at all). Settings → Reminders →
  Remind me before prayer is now a list, like the adhan voices; 15 is still the default.
- The Hijri date comes first: on Home it is the line under the clock (with the city) and the Gregorian date is
  the smaller line below it; on Prayer day the date line starts with it.
- The verse reference under the arch («النساء 103») follows the digits setting like every other number; it was
  always Eastern Arabic (١٠٣), even with Western digits chosen. It is the only surah:ayah reference on screen:
  Friday, Ramadan, the call screen and the screensaver show none.

## [0.4] - 2026-10-22

### Added
- 59 more cities, now 136 in 43 countries: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia, Malaysia,
  Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
  Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa,
  Australia and New Zealand, plus Houston and Los Angeles. Each starts on its mosques' calculation method. Thanks,
  @mohammed-althaf-h (#4).

### Changed
- Location is picked by region first (Arab world, Asia, Europe, Americas, Africa, Oceania), then country (A to Z),
  then city, so no list is longer than 16.
- Picking a city also sets its usual Asr school: Hanafi for Pakistan, Bangladesh and most Indian cities (Kerala and
  Chennai stay Shafi'i). The Asr row can still change it.

### Fixed
- In Settings, list chooser items no longer draw over the chooser's title when scrolled (#8, thanks
  @mohammed-althaf-h in #9).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-22

### Changed
- Settings keys are the same on every row: the arrows only move (toward the start side goes back to the
  sections), and OK is the only key that changes anything. OK on a choice or the Hijri offset starts editing it
  (a ring shows round the control): ◀▶ move the choice, OK saves, Back cancels. OK flips a switch and opens a
  list as before. Every save shows "✓ Saved" at the end of the hint line for 2 s. Reported in #5 (thanks,
  @mohammed-althaf-h).

## [0.3] - 2026-10-22

### Added
- United States in the location list, with New York, Chicago and Dallas (ISNA method).
  The Hijri date and Ramadan mode still use Umm al-Qura, so US users who follow local moon sighting set the Hijri
  offset.
- A web preview of the launcher in `site/` (Astro, deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/site.yml`): every
  screen in Arabic and English, driven by the arrow keys like the remote, with live prayer times for the visitor's
  chosen city. It reads the app's own strings (`Text.java`), cities, methods, stations and fonts at build time, so
  it never keeps a second copy. One page per screen and mode, with titles, descriptions, `hreflang`, a sitemap and
  structured data for search engines.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue templates (bug, prayer times or city, TV report, idea) and a pull
  request template. `THIRD_PARTY.md` now lists every radio station and the reciter channels.

### Changed
- `afnon-mihrab/tokens.json` is the single source of the design tokens. `Tokens.java` and `colors.xml` are now
  generated from it (`npm run tokens` in `site/`, Style Dictionary), as is the site's CSS; CI fails if they drift.
  The 15 colours that were hard-coded in the app (screensaver, menus, the reminder card, Qibla rings, the banner
  track, the Settings sidebar) are tokens now. Every value is unchanged.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed
- A prayer's reminder and the call to prayer no longer come back after you close them. Each check computed the
  prayer's time with a few different milliseconds, so it never matched the one already shown; the reminder
  returned within 15 s and the call screen during its first two minutes. What was shown is also saved, so a
  restart of the remote buttons service (low memory, TCL's background manager) doesn't show it again.

## [0.2] - 2026-10-21

### Added
- Radio stations: Settings → Radio → Station picks broadcast Quran radios (Cairo, Nablus, Shabab FM Quran, Qatar 1
  and 2, Jordan) or one of 10 reciters' 24/7 channels from mp3quran.net. Each URL is the station's own stream;
  the same single player plays them. Home's card, the screensaver and the screen-off view show the station.
  `--es station <id>` picks one from adb.
- 57 cities, for 74 in 13 countries. Coordinates and Arabic names from Wikipedia/Wikidata.
  - Palestine, the seat of every governorate: Jerusalem, Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jenin, Tulkarm,
    Qalqilya, Salfit, Tubas, Jericho, Gaza, Jabalia, Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis and Rafah.
  - Lebanon (Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek), Syria (Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Latakia, Deir ez-Zor),
    Iraq (Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Erbil, Najaf, Karbala, Kirkuk, Sulaymaniyah), Bahrain (Manama, Muharraq),
    Oman (Muscat, Salalah, Sohar, Nizwa) and Yemen (Sanaa, Aden, Taiz, Hodeidah, Mukalla).
  - More cities where there was one: Saudi Arabia (Jeddah, Dammam, Taif, Tabuk, Abha) with Umm al-Qura,
    UAE (Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Al Ain) with the Dubai method, Jordan (Irbid, Zarqa, Aqaba).
  - The new countries use the Muslim World League method, like Amman; the method row can still change it.
- A `redirects` preference (`from=to` package pairs) that opens another app whenever one app's screen comes up,
  for remote buttons the firmware hard-wires to an app that can't be replaced (`Redirects.java`). Empty by default.
- A `key_filter` preference (`auto`, `on`, `off`) to force key filtering on or off on a TV the guess gets wrong.

### Changed
- Location picks a country first, then one of its cities, so the remote never scrolls through all 74. A country
  with a single city is picked at once.

### Fixed
- On TVs whose firmware answers the remote's buttons itself (CVTE boards, e.g. Super General), holding Volume
  works continuously and the Source button opens the TV's own source menu again. The remote buttons service no
  longer filters keys there (`FirmwareKeys.java`, detected by CVTE's `android.intent.action.HOTKEYSERVICE`).
  CVTE's firmware leaves Source to the app in front, so Home now opens the TV's source menu itself.
- `tools/install.sh` grants location, so Home shows the Wi-Fi name on a fresh install (Android 9+ hides it otherwise).
- Where the service still filters keys, a button whose target is missing (an app that isn't installed, or no
  Android TV inputs screen) now passes through to the TV instead of doing nothing.
- Settings no longer stops answering OK after you leave it with a list open (city, method, adhan) and change
  something elsewhere, such as the room direction: coming back rebuilt the screen without the list but kept it
  marked as open.
- In the settings lists (cities, methods, adhan voices), items scrolled up no longer draw over the list's title.
- Settings → Room direction stays open. Settings acts on OK's press and the picker on its release, so the same
  press closed the picker at once and saved 0°.
- Screen off while listening uses TCL's Audio Only on Android TV 11 TCL sets too (tested on a C06_2K_GB set),
  where TCL Settings hosts it in `com.tcl.settings` instead of `com.android.tv.settings`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-21

### Fixed
- Holding Volume Up or Down on the remote changes the volume continuously again, instead of one step per hold.
  The remote buttons service no longer filters keys on TCL TVs, which had stopped held keys from repeating.

### Changed
- On TCL TVs, the remote's app, Settings, Input and All apps buttons are now handed to TCL's own button
  remapping (`TclKeys.java`). Other TVs keep the previous behaviour.
- `tools/install.sh` and the other tools find adb by themselves (PATH, the Android SDK in `local.properties`,
  `ANDROID_HOME`, or the default SDK folder). `ADB_BIN` still overrides.
- `tools/restore.sh` also removes the TCL button mappings.

## [0.1] - 2026-10-21

First public release.

### Added
- Home with the next prayer and a live countdown in a mihrab arch, the day's six times, favourites and more apps.
- Today's prayers with an adhan on/off bell per prayer, the Qibla dial and room direction.
- Reminders before each prayer, and the call screen with the adhan at prayer time.
- 14 adhan voices plus a separate Fajr adhan.
- Friday (Jumu'ah, Surat al-Kahf) and Ramadan (iftar and suhoor) modes.
- Quran Radio Cairo 98.2 FM with live level bars; pauses for the adhan; screen off while listening (TCL Audio Only).
- Screensaver, on-TV settings and remote button mapping.
- Arabic (RTL) first, with English.
